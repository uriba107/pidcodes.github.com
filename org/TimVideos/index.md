## [TimVideos.us](https://code.timvideos.us)

[TimVideos.us](https://code.timvideos.us) is a group of exciting projects which
together create a system for doing both recording and live event streaming for
conferences, meetings, user groups and other presentations.

We hope that, [through our projects](https://hdmi2usb.tv), the costs and
expertise currently required to produce live streaming events will be reduced
to near zero. We wish to develop a system where everyone has the ability to
record presentations and host live remote participants across the globe.

## [HDMI2USB.tv](https://hdmi2usb.tv)

The [HDMI2USB project](https://hdmi2usb.tv) develops affordable hardware
options to record and stream HD videos (from HDMI & DisplayPort sources) for
conferences, meetings and user groups.

We are currently developing our own hardware (the Numato Opsis), and also
provide firmware for various prototyping boards.
