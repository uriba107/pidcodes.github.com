Our Open Source software is called the Great Cow BASIC suite.  The  Great Cow BASIC suite is robust and fully functional compiler and assembler.   Using Great Cow BASIC is the fastest method to program a Microchip PIC or Atmel AVR 8-bit microcontroller for those just starting and the professional user.

We have developed three USB solutions are follows:

1. CDC solution using Great Cow BASIC for the USB stack for PIC18 and AVRs
2. HID solution using Great Cow BASIC for the USB stack for PIC18
3. Special protocol solution solution Great Cow BASIC for the USB stack for PIC18 and AVRs for educational testing of software
