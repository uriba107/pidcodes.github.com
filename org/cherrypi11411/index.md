Cherry Pi Team 11411 is a FIRST Tech Challenge Robotics team passionate about robots and learning. We have created a board to translate the SPI signals from a PMW-3901 optical flow chip into I2C that we can then use with FTC robots. This board uses a microcontroller for that translation which can be plugged in to a USB port for updates.
