I have no "ORGANISATION" :-). This is DIY project. Creation idea is taken from very popular idea to create simple and cheap DDS based signal
generator exposed on https://scienceprog.com/avr-dds-signal-generator-v20/  With difference from it there will be present:
1. More powerfull 32 bit MCU
2. USB interface instead of LCD to start/stop and configure waves.
