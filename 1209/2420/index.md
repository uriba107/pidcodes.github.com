The german foto podcast legend Happy Shooting had a discussion about Midi controller for Lightroom. One comment on the website and voila a new project is born. This project will (hopefully) contain everything from zero to hero to get create your own customized Midi Controller for Lightroom. It is completly community driven, so everyone is allowed to contribute. And it's not intended to earn money with it. Just from the community for the community. In general you might even need no case, just the pcb with the solded parts. so you will get an extra small extra lightwight device. If that's the thing for you we might even go the capacitive way and reduce the soldered components and weight to a minimum.
