The CKT-AVRPROGRAMMER is a derivation of the various USBtinyISP
programmers, such as SparkFun's Pocket AVR Programmer or Adafruit's
USBtinyISP, that includes the ability to power either a 3.3V or 5V target
and has inrush/target short protection.  

We would ideally like to make this an open VID/PID that all open derivations of
Dick Streefland's original USBtinyISP programmer can share, since there is
currently no "open" VID/PID that these derivations can use.
