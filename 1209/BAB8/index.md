NFCopyCat is a device to make replay attacks against NFC payment systems with Magspoof. This tiny version is a combination of SAMD21 and a small PN532 board. Adding a 3.7 LiPo battery. Also I added a LED with a resistor just for debugging and to show activity.


With love for everyone from Aguascalientes - Mexico.
