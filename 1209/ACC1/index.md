The [Accelerando Redsoil](https://github.com/accelerando-consulting/accelerando_redsoil)
is a breakout board for the eByte E73 module with nrf52840 CPU.

Redsoil provides a breadboard-friendly platform that is
perhaps the simplest possible board that is fully CircuitPython
compliant.

The Redsoil also runs Arduino, and Zephyr OS.

The Redsoil was created by Accelerando in order to provide a platform
for rapid prototyping of extremely low-cost IoT solutions.
