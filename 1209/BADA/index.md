After getting fed up with the state of mechanical keyboards a few years ago,
MXKeyboard became DX-MON's brainchild.

How about a mechanical backlit keyboard which has has no LED flicker by not
using LED matrix scanning, and with full n-Key rollover and the usual gaming goodies.
Additionally, how about a keyboard that is on-surface reprogrammable, with profiles
for saved configurations of settings, full control of debounce, key-down time,
key-up time, and software switch actuation type (momentary, latching), and which
can be connected via one or both of USB and PS/2 with OTG mobile functionality?

Well, now you have MXKeyboard. A free, open-source hardware and software typing
platform, suitable for the photo-sensitive, motor-imparied, gaming, and touch typing.
Type how you like without having to screw about with your PC's settings, and take your
preferences anywhere.
